# âœŠâœ‹ðŸ”Œ - Rock, Paper, Sockets

A small rock-paper-scissors game w/chat using Phoenix Channels (websockets) and React, embedded inside a Phoenix application.

## Getting Started

...tbc ðŸ™ˆ

### Why did I do this?

This is just a little project I am making for fun, and learning purposes.

I decided to work on a little app in Phoenix/React for a chance to work on the latest versions of the stacks, as well as learn/play with some techs I hadn't necessarily played with before.

### What do I hope to learn?

 - Phoenix Channels / Websockets
 - React Channels API
 - React Embedded inside Phoenix (As opposed to running as a separate application with a separate repo)
 - Phoenix Tokens
 - Elixir Releases / Deployment
